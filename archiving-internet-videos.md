# Archiving Internet Videos

Because everything on the internet is ephemeral and could disappear at any moment, there are valid reasons for archiving internet videos. In some cases, it is legitimate and legal to make a personal archival copy, just to make sure that instructional content remains available for future reference. These are instructions for how to archive online videos:

## Youtube (...also Vimeo and other streaming sites)

- Use [Clipgrab](https://clipgrab.org/faqs/howto-download-youtube-video) to grab the video

## Kanopy

- This will only work for videos without DRM
- [Reddit Thread is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/190ocz7/ripping_content_from_kanopy/) // TODO: duplicate and simplify instructions here

## Internet Archive

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is a great source for older media. No ripping necessary - files can be downloaded.
