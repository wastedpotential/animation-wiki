# Stop Motion Puppets

## Scale

- 1:12 = Common Dollhouse scale. 1 inch = 1 foot. This is a little small for most stop motion. The advantage is that set building would be much easier with many common items available.
- 1:24 = Dollhouse "half scale." Too small for stop motion.
- 1:6 = Fashion doll (Barbie) scale. This is recommended by many stop motion books, but is a little large. 2 inches = 1 foot. Common puppets will be about 12" tall.
- 1:8 = Aardman scale. 1.5" = 1 foot, so a common puppet will be about 9" tall. This is a good size for stop motion in most cases, but all sets and props will need to be handmade becasue it's not a common toy scale.
