# Stop Motion Puppets

## Scale

- 1:12 = Common Dollhouse scale. 1 inch = 1 foot. This is a little small for most stop motion. The advantage is that set building would be much easier with many common items available.
- 1:24 = Dollhouse "half scale." Too small for stop motion.
- 1:6 = Fashion doll (Barbie) scale. This is recommended by many stop motion books, but is a little large. 2 inches = 1 foot. Common puppets will be about 12" tall.
- 1:8 = Aardman scale. 1.5" = 1 foot, so a common puppet will be about 9" tall. This is a good size for stop motion in most cases, but all sets and props will need to be handmade because it's not a common toy scale.

## Clay

Most american polymer clay is too soft for animation. For example, Sculpey can be used if any non-moving pieces are baked, but the moveable pieces (not baked) will be very soft and easily distorted.

Recommended Clay for animation is a Plastilina-type clay It is oil and wax based, so it won't dry out. It can be warmed up for easier sculpting, but is fairly rigid at cooler temperatures. Brand names include:

Sulphur-free\*:

- Newplast - Not actually available anymore. Searching for "Newplast" may bring up alternatives available in Europe or online
- Craft Smart Plastalina - available at Michaels (can be hard and crumbly)

\*Clay must be sulphur free to use it for molding silicone
