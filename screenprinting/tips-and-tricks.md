# Screenprinting Tips and Tricks

## Screen Mesh:

| Application                 | Screen Mesh  |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| athletic jersey (heavy ink) | 60-86 mesh   |
| standard 1 color print      | 125-156 mesh |
| halftones or softer feel    | 180-230 mesh |
| process printing CMYK       | 305-355 mesh |

Yellow mesh will prevent light bouncing during exposure, creating a crisper stencil.

## Emulsion:

- Dual cure emulsion are more forgiving - they have more flexible exposure times
- 1 part emulsion has very unforgiving exposure time
- Before coating screen with emulsion...
  - degrease it (simple green)
  - rinse it out
  - dry it
- When coating screen with emulsion, coat bottom (outside) first, then top (inside)
- 1 coat on each side of the screen is usually enough

## Exposing the stencil:

- Get transparency done at Kinko's For best results
- If printing transparency at home, laser printers often cause the transparency to shrink slightly, which can make multi-color prints difficult to align.
- Position transparency on screen and tape it in pace (just 2 pieces of tape on opposite corners)
- Transparency ink side should be against the bottom of the screen (emulsion to emulsion)
- Don't forget that t-shirts are usually printed upside down in the press

## Wash out the stencil:

- Wash screen out with cool water
- If emulsion doesn't wash out easily, it's overexposed. Use shorter exposure time
- If too much washes away or emulsion feels slimy when wet, it's underexposed
- After washing out, blot excess water away or use a shop vac to vacuum it away
- Put it out in sun to dry again, which also finishes exposing it
- Can get an exposure calculator to help calculate the exposure time for your conditions
