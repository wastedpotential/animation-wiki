# Screenprinting Tips and Tricks

## Screen Mesh:

| Application                   | Screen Mesh    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| glitter ink                   | 40 mesh        |
| athletic jersey (heavy ink)   | 60-86 mesh     |
| underbase white (heavy ink)   | 110 mesh       |
| standard 1 color print        | 125-156 mesh   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| halftones or softer feel\*    | 180-230 mesh   |
| process printing CMYK\*       | 305-355 mesh   |

\* For detail designs, take the lpi of the design and multiply by 4.5 to get the minimum mesh count you need

Yellow mesh will prevent light bouncing during exposure, creating a crisper stencil.

### Screen tension:

25- 30 newtons = IDEAL
20 Newtons = OK
below 15 = PROBABLY TIME TO REPLACE

## Emulsion:

- Dual cure emulsion are more forgiving - they have more flexible exposure times
- 1 part emulsion has very unforgiving exposure time
- Before coating screen with emulsion...
  - degrease it (simple green)
  - rinse it out
  - dry it
- if using a scoop coater, use the sharp edge (thinner coats), not the rounded edge (thicker coats)
- When coating screen with emulsion, coat bottom (outside) first, then top (inside)
- 1 coat on each side of the screen is usually enough

## Stencil Transparency Prep

**_This still does NOT work!_**

- Export to PDF (any settings here to prevent size change?)
- Open in browser and hit "Print"
- Print using System Dialog (Ctrl-Shift-P)
- Disable "Let the App change my printing preferences"
- Go to "More Settings"
- Select "glossy photo paper", "high" quality
- Crank intensity of all colors up
- Set brightness to dark
- Crank overall intensity up

## Exposing the stencil:

- Download the free version of [PrintFab](https://www.printfab.com/en/) and [set up a new printer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXsOVMMyhfw). I recommend setting the ink density to 400%. Then, use this printer to print your stencils
- If printing transparency at home, laser printers often cause the transparency to shrink slightly, which can make multi-color prints difficult to align.
- Position transparency on screen and tape it in pace (just 2 pieces of tape on opposite corners)
- Use a piece of non-UV glass to hold the stencil tightly to the screen. Do NOT use Plexiglass - it is UV-resistant.
- Transparency ink side should be against the bottom of the screen (emulsion to emulsion)
- Don't forget that t-shirts are usually printed upside down in the press

## Wash out the stencil:

- Wash screen out with cool water
- If emulsion doesn't wash out easily, it's overexposed. Use shorter exposure time
- If too much washes away or emulsion feels slimy when wet, it's underexposed
- After washing out, blot excess water away or use a shop vac to vacuum it away
- Put it out in sun to dry again, which also finishes exposing it
- If there are pinholes in the cured emulsion, add blockout or tape to the bottom of the screen to cover them
- Tape the non-emulsion-coated ares of the screen with painter's tape on the bottom of the screen
  - ... unless you are using roller frames - then tape the top of the screen to keep ink from working it's way into the corners
- Can get an exposure calculator to help calculate the exposure time for your conditions

## Inks:

- Plastisol is most common for garments
  - Plastisol must be cured at 320 degrees
  - Plastisol ink won't dry out in the screen
- Plastisol Types:
  - GP (general purpose) is for light colored garments
  - HO (high opacity) is for dark garments
  - Athletic Plastisol is tougher, more abrasion resistant
- A Flash unit can cure plastisol
- Curable or Balanced Reducer will thin it out

## Mounting the screen:

- Loosen micro locks
- Make sure all micro adjusters are centered
- Tighten micro locks
- Use a t-square to add some vertical and horizontal lines to the platten
- Put screen in press and line it up with guide lines you just drew
- Tighten screen clamps
- check that the off-contact is 1/16" - 1/8"
- spray platten with spray adhesive or water-based table adhesive

## Squeegee and printing:

- Durometer measures hardness
- Use a sharp-edged squeegee
- Roll bottom of shirt outward at bottom. This makes sure any accidental ink transfer ends up on the inside of the shirt
- pull it so neck is tight on top of platten and shirt is centered
- then pull it back up so the neck is only about 2 inches below the tip of the platten
- PRess it down onto the adhesive
- load it with ink
- draw it across the print, holding it at 45 degrees
- pressure should be enough to slightly deflect the blade
- first print may need more than 1 pass
- check for pinholes and cover them
- For second (third, fourth...) color, cover first print with packing tape to test print registration. If it's not right, the ink can be wiped off and retried
- if registration is slightly off, use micro adjust to fix
- print colors from light to dark (typically)
- on light shirts, colors can be printed wet on wet, curing only at the end
- on dark shirts, you may flash after a color so that you can do a second pass with the same color to build it up
- cure it with Flash dryer (about 2"-4" above shirt). Use temperature indicator or infrared gun to check > 320 degrees
- if excess ink builds up under the screen, you can wipe it off with a dry cottom rag/shirt.
  - watch that you don't end up with ink around the edges of any tape!

### Dark Shirts

- Ink should be thicker to help cover garment
- 86 - 125 mesh for single color print
- color over white print:
  - higher mesh count if you are running a base white and adding color on top
  - top color will be on a higher mesh count (280 - 305)
- to get bright white, do a print, flash, print of the same color
