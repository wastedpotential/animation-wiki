# Random Dragonframe Notes

## Keypad

The external physical keypad works when connected with a USB cable. Bluetooth seems problematic.

If you're having trouble with the keypad...

- Press the Num Lock key on your keyboard
  "AHA!," you say, "I don't have a Num Lock key!"

- Press Window + Ctrl + O to get the accessibility keyboard to appear
- press the Num Lock key
- Close the keyboard
- Try the keypad again
